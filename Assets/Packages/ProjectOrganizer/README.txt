## Usage

1. **Set Up Rules and Folders**

   - By default, the tool scans the `Assets` folder.
   - You can add or remove included/excluded folders in the config panel.
   - Set extension mappings to define where each file type should go.

2. **Set File Types to Scan**

   - Enter the file extensions you want to manage (comma or semicolon separated).
   - Example: `.cs, .shader, .png`

3. **Exclude Folders**

   - System folders (`ProjectSettings`, `Packages`, etc.) are auto-excluded.
   - Add your own folders to exclude as needed.

4. **Scan and Select Files**

   - Click **Scan files** to find all files matching your settings.
   - Use search and toggles to select which files you want to move.

5. **Preview Moves & Dry Run**

   - See exactly what will be moved, from where, to where.
   - Use **Dry run** to simulate the move without making any changes.

6. **Organize!**

   - Hit **üöÄ ORGANIZE NOW** to actually move all selected files.
   - The folder structure is auto-created as needed.
   - A log appears at the bottom with a summary.

7. **Undo Last Move**

   - You can **undo the last organize** operation using the **UNDO** button (as long as you haven‚Äôt closed Unity).
   - For extra safety, always use version control.

## FAQ

Q: Does it delete files?
A: No. Files are only moved using Unity‚Äôs AssetDatabase.MoveAsset. No files are deleted.

Q: Can I undo?
A: Use version control! Unity‚Äôs undo system does not support asset moves like this. It is highly recommended to use Git or Plastic SCM.

Q: Will it move files outside Assets?
A: No, only files inside `Assets` (and subfolders) are moved.
